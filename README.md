# Basic-Firewall
This is a basic firewall project where you can control what Ips & Ports to block and what is accepted by the firewall program it is composed of a basic python code and you can use Wireshark to help in the packet analysis or you could use a packet sniffer library if you do not have the basic info about wireshark.
There are 2 code files one that uses a file with the readigs from wireshark and the other uses packet sniffer library instead of having to open wireshark and gather data from the network manually
